  abstract  = {In recent years, researchers have shown a vested interest in developing advanced information technologies, machine-learning algorithms, and risk-assessment tools to detect and analyze radical content online, with increased attention on identifying violent extremists or measuring digital pathways of violent radicalization. Yet overlooked in this evolving space has been a systematic examination of what constitutes radical posting behaviors in general. This study uses a sentiment analysis-based algorithm that adapts criminal career measures - and is guided by communication research on social influence - to develop and describe three radical posting behaviors (high-intensity, high-frequency, and high-duration) found on a sub-forum of the most conspicuous right-wing extremist forum. The results highlight the multi-dimensional nature of radical right-wing posting behaviors, many of which may inform future risk factor frameworks used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies to identify credible threats online.

  abstract  = {Social media data have recently attracted considerable attention as an emerging voice of the customer as it has rapidly become a channel for exchanging and storing customer-generated, large-scale, and unregulated voices about products. Although product planning studies using social media data have used systematic methods for product planning, their methods have limitations, such as the difficulty of identifying latent product features due to the use of only term-level analysis and insufficient consideration of opportunity potential analysis of the identified features. Therefore, an opportunity mining approach is proposed in this study to identify product opportunities based on topic modeling and sentiment analysis of social media data. For a multifunctional product, this approach can identify latent product topics discussed by product customers in social media using topic modeling, thereby quantifying the importance of each product topic. Next, the satisfaction level of each product topic is evaluated using sentiment analysis. Finally, the opportunity value and improvement direction of each product topic from a customer-centered view are identified by an opportunity algorithm based on product topics’ importance and satisfaction. We expect that our approach for product planning will contribute to the systematic identification of product opportunities from large-scale customer-generated social media data and will be used as a real-time monitoring tool for changing customer needs analysis in rapidly evolving product environments.

  abstract  = {Users express and share sentiments electronically when they communicate within online social network applications. One way to analyze such interdependent data is focusing on the inter-user relationships by applying a sociological perspective based on social network analysis. Existing studies examined the existence or distribution of sentiments in online communication at a general level or in small observed groups. After a brief introduction into social network analysis, this chapter extends this research by studying ego-networks of focal actors (ego) and their immediate contacts in over 13,000 online social networks. Sentiment valence of all messages was determined with a trained and tested software algorithm. To explain sentiment- related patterns we draw from research on social influence and social attachment to develop theories of node polarization, balance effects and sentiment mirroring within communication dyads. Results from social network analysis support our theories and indicate that actors develop polarized sentiments towards individual peers but keep sentiment in balance on the ego-network level. Further, pairs of nodes tend to establish similar attitudes towards each other leading to stable and polarized positive or negative relationships. These results contribute to understanding the patterns of how sentiment propagates and resonates in large online groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {Text sentiment analysis, also referred to as emotional polarity computation, has become a flourishing frontier in the text mining community. This paper studies online forums hotspot detection and forecast using sentiment analysis and text mining approaches. First, we create an algorithm to automatically analyze the emotional polarity of a text and to obtain a value for each piece of text. Second, this algorithm is combined with K-means clustering and support vector machine (SVM) to develop unsupervised text mining approach. We use the proposed text mining approach to group the forums into various clusters, with the center of each representing a hotspot forum within the current time span. The data sets used in our empirical studies are acquired and formatted from Sina sports forums, which spans a range of 31 different topic forums and 220,053 posts. Experimental results demonstrate that SVM forecasting achieves highly consistent results with K-means clustering. The top 10 hotspot forums listed by SVM forecasting resembles 80% of K-means clustering results. Both SVM and K-means achieve the same results for the top 4 hotspot forums of the year.

  title     = {Locally weighted linear regression for cross-lingual valence-arousal prediction of affective words.},
  doi       = {10.1016/j.neucom.2016.02.057},
  abstract  = {Dimensional sentiment analysis that aims to predict a continuous numerical value on multiple dimensions, such as the valence-arousal (VA) space, has attracted more attention in recent years. Compared to the categorical approach that focuses on sentiment classification such as binary classification (positive and negative), the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. Therefore, recent studies have investigated the automatic development of affective lexicons with VA ratings because such resources are fundamental and useful for building dimensional sentiment applications. Due to the limited number of VA lexicons, a cross-lingual approach has emerged that aims to estimate the VA ratings of affective words of one language from those of another language based on linear regression or other regression methods. However, one of the major limitations of linear regression is the under-fitting problem which can cause a poor fit between the algorithm and the training data. To tackle this problem, this study proposes a locally weighted method to improve linear regression for predicting the valence-arousal values of affective words. This method performs a regression around the point of interest using only training data that are “local” to that point, and thus can reduce the impact of noise from unrelated training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a lower error rate and a higher correlation coefficient for predicting the VA ratings of Chinese affective words from English VA lexicons.

However, as of yet, there is little empirical evidence in regard to specific problems users face when applying such systems in everyday situations. This article contributes a novel method and analysis to investigate such problems as reported by users: We analysed 45,448 reviews of four apps on the Google Play Store (Facebook, Netflix, Google Maps, and Google Assistant) with sentiment analysis and topic modelling to reveal problems during interaction that can be attributed to the apps’ algorithmic decision-making. We enriched this data with users’ coping and support strategies through a follow-up online survey (N = 286). In particular, we found problems and strategies related to content, algorithm, user choice, and feedback. We discuss corresponding implications for designing user support, highlighting the importance of user control and explanations of output rather than processes.

In this paper, we explore the use of fuzzy logic for modeling concept polarities, and the uncertainty associated with them, with respect to different domains. The approach is based on the use of a knowledge graph built by combining two linguistic resources, namely WordNet and SenticNet. Such a knowledge graph is then exploited by a graph-propagation algorithm that propagates sentiment information learned from labeled datasets. The system implementing the proposed approach has been evaluated on the Blitzer dataset. The results demonstrate its viability in real-world cases.

  title     = {A multilingual semi-supervised approach in deriving singlish sentic patterns for polarity detection.},
  doi       = {10.1016/j.knosys.2016.04.024},
  abstract  = {Due to the huge volume and linguistic variation of data shared online, accurate detection of the sentiment of a message (polarity detection) can no longer rely on human assessors or through simple lexicon keyword matching. This paper presents a semi-supervised approach in constructing essential toolkits for analysing the polarity of a localised scarce-resource language, Singlish (Singaporean English). Corpus-based bootstrapping using a multilingual, multifaceted lexicon was applied to construct an annotated testing dataset, while unsupervised methods such as lexicon polarity detection, frequent item extraction through association rules and latent semantic analysis were used to identify the polarity of Singlish n-grams before human assessment was done to isolate misleading terms and remove concept ambiguity. The findings suggest that this multilingual approach outshines polarity analysis using only the English language. In addition, a hybrid combination of the Support Vector Machine and a proposed Singlish Polarity Detection algorithm, which incorporates unigram and n-gram Singlish sentic patterns with other multilingual polarity sentic patterns such as negation and adversative, is able to outperform other approaches in comparison. The promising results of a pooled testing dataset generated from the vast amount of unannotated Singlish data clearly show that our multilingual Singlish sentic pattern approach has the potential to be adopted in real-world polarity detection.

  abstract  = {Introduction: Predicting the sentiments and emotions of people from their texts is a critical issue in cognitive computing. The explosive growth of social network services has led to a tremendous increase of textual data, increasing the demand of the advanced analysis of these data. Sentiment analysis on textual social media data emerged in recent years to fulfill the needs of areas such as national security, business, politics, and economics; however, text messages from social networks are rather different from those of traditional text documents, especially in presentation style and lengths. Therefore, it is difficult but essential to develop an effective method to explore the sentiments of social messages. Methods: In this study, we first applied a self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm to cluster social messages as well as sentiment keywords. An association discovery process was then applied to discover the associations between a message and some sentiment keywords, and the sentiment of a message was determined according to such associations. Results: We performed experiments on collected Twitter messages and the results’ accuracy outperformed that of a similar approach. Conclusions: A sentiment analysis approach based on SOMs was proposed. The associations between messages and keywords were derived using the proposed method. The novelty of this work arises from the adoption of association discovery process in sentiment analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis has become one of the mainstream researches in social network analysis. Its impact can be seen in many practical applications, ranging from public opinion analysis to marketing of public praise and information prediction. However, most of the existing research has been performed in the sentiment classification for subjective text, the emotional evolution analysis for complex interactive text (e.g., online reviews) has not yet been thoroughly targeted by the research community. This paper is concerned on short-text Chinese online reviews collected from Tianya forum. First, an efficient affective computing framework is proposed to capture the underlying emotions of Chinese online reviews. It can accurately calculate the semantic orientation of the entire review, without requiring expensive manual labeling of seed words. As users’ attitudes might influence with each other, predicting their future emotional behaviors that only relying on the emotional values of historical reviews is very one-sided. Therefore, we propose a game theory based emotional evolution prediction algorithm combining the affective computing, in which the mixed nash equilibrium strategies are calculated as the future emotional behavior of interactive users. Then, experimental results on the large-scaled review dataset are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and accurateness of our approaches. Finally, by applying the research results on the pairwise happiness-popularity coordination evaluation, we have revealed some interesting phenomenon on the “World View” board in Tianya forum.

  abstract  = {In this research, we propose a series of models designed to take advantage of the availability of data---both structured and unstructured---from a variety of sources ranging including passive data, questionnaires, and social media data to analyze underlying patterns and trends in travel and activity behavior, and to provide results that support enhancements both in transportation planning and the application of programming to support such efforts. First, we introduce a framework for automatically inferring the travel modes and trip purposes of human movement when tracked by a GPS device. We utilize a multiple changepoints algorithm to divide trajectories into segments using only speed data. Then, Random Forest is used to classify segments into moving and not-moving types. For moving segments, travel mode (car, bus, train, walk, and bike) is predicted. Next, multiple machine learning algorithms are employed, validated, and tested to identify the most suitable model for inferring trip purposes. The overall accuracy for prediction is over 80% on the testing set, both with and without data on socio-demographic variables. The model also predicts "shop" trips with an accuracy of 92.1%, while its accuracy for "go home" and "studying" trips reaches 100%. Additionally, we utilize the classification results in the first stage of research to compare households' travel patterns from before a new light rail transit line began service to two periods of time after service began. Our results indicate that, although the average of activity duration varies significantly over days of week and waves, the random effect of these two factors on activity duration was minor; time of day contributed over one third of the total variance in the duration. Finally, the dissertation demonstrates uses of Twitter data as a potentially important data source to understand comments, criticisms, and responses about light rail in Los Angeles. The results of information flow analysis, sentiment estimation, topic modeling, and its application can be useful for exploring trends among commuters and how their sentiment changed according to the light rail line they used, the time of day, and the day of the week.

  doi       = {10.1016/j.dss.2018.08.009},
  abstract  = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a promising approach to analyze consumer reviews at a high level of detail, where the opinion about each feature of the product or service is considered. ABSA usually explores supervised inductive learning algorithms, which requires intense human effort for the labeling process. In this paper, we investigate Cross-Domain Transfer Learning approaches, in which aspects already labeled in some domains can be used to support the aspect extraction of another domain where there are no labeled aspects. Existing cross-domain transfer learning approaches learn classifiers from labeled aspects in the source domain and then apply these classifiers in the target domain, i.e., two separate stages that may cause inconsistency due to different feature spaces. To overcome this drawback, we present an innovative approach called CD-ALPHN (Cross-Domain Aspect Label Propagation through Heterogeneous Networks). First, we propose a heterogeneous network-based representation that combines different features (labeled aspects, unlabeled aspects, and linguistic features) from source and target domain as nodes in a single network. Second, we propose a label propagation algorithm for aspect extraction from heterogeneous networks, where the linguistic features are used as a bridge for this propagation. Our algorithm is based on a transductive learning process, where we explore both labeled and unlabeled aspects during the label propagation. Experimental results show that the CD-ALPHN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in scenarios where there is a high-level of inconsistency between the source and target domains--the most common scenario in real-world applications.

  abstract  = {Background: Twitter has become the “wild-west” of marketing and promotional strategies for advertisement agencies. Electronic cigarettes have been heavily marketed across Twitter feeds, offering discounts, “kid-friendly” flavors, algorithmically generated false testimonials, and free samples. Methods: All electronic cigarette keyword related tweets from a 10% sample of Twitter spanning January 2012 through December 2014 (approximately 850,000 total tweets) were identified and categorized as Automated or Organic by combining a keyword classification and a machine trained Human Detection algorithm. A sentiment analysis using Hedonometrics was performed on Organic tweets to quantify the change in consumer sentiments over time. Commercialized tweets were topically categorized with key phrasal pattern matching. Results: The overwhelming majority (80%) of tweets were classified as automated or promotional in nature. The majority of these tweets were coded as commercialized (83.65%in 2013), up to 33% of which offered discounts or free samples and appeared on over a billion twitter feeds as impressions. The positivity of Organic (human) classified tweets has decreased over time (5.84 in 2013 to 5.77 in 2014) due to a relative increase in the negative words ‘ban’, ‘tobacco’, ‘doesn’t’, ‘drug’, ‘against’, ‘poison’, ‘tax’ and a relative decrease in the positive words like ‘haha’, ‘good’, ‘cool’. Automated tweets are more positive than organic (6.17 versus 5.84) due to a relative increase in the marketing words like ‘best’, ‘win’, ‘buy’, ‘sale’, ‘health’, ‘discount’ and a relative decrease in negative words like ‘bad’, ‘hate’, ‘stupid’, ‘don’t’. Conclusions: Due to the youth presence on Twitter and the clinical uncertainty of the long term health complications of electronic cigarette consumption, the protection of public health warrants scrutiny and potential regulation of social media marketing.

  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0260290},
  abstract  = {Background: With the spread of COVID-19, significant concerns have been raised about the potential increased risk for electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users for COVID-19 infection and related syndromes. Social media is an increasingly popular source for health information dissemination and discussion, and can affect health outcomes. Objective: This study aims to identify the topics in the public vaping discussion in COVID-19-related Twitter posts in order to get insight into public vaping-related perceptions, attitudes and concerns, and to discern possible misinformation and misconceptions around vaping in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Using the tweets ID database maintained by Georgia State University’s Panacea Lab, we downloaded the tweets related to COVID-19 from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to February 12, 2021. We used R to analyze the tweets that contained a list of 79 keywords related to vaping. After removing duplicates and tweets created by faked accounts or bots, the final data set consisted of 11,337 unique tweets from 7,710 different users. We performed the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling and carried out a sentiment analysis. Results: Despite fluctuations, the number of daily tweets was relatively stable (average number of daily tweets = 33.4) with a sole conspicuous spike happening on a few days after August 11, 2020 when a research team published findings that teenagers and young adults who vape face a much higher risk of COVID-19 infection than their peers who do not vape. Topic modeling generated 8 topics: linkage between vaping and risk of COVID-19 infection, vaping pneumonia and the origin of COVID-19, vaping and spread of COVID-19, vaping regulation, calling for quitting vaping, protecting youth, similarity between e-cigarette or vaping- associated lung injury (EVALI) and COVID-19, and sales information. Daily sentiment scores showed that the public sentiment was predominantly negative, but became slightly more positive over the course of the study time period. Conclusions: While some content in the public discourse on vaping before the COVID-19 pandemic continued in Twitter posts during the COVID-19 time period, new topics emerged. We found a substantial amount of anti-vaping discussion and dominantly negative sentiment around vaping during COVID-19, a sharp contrast to the predominantly pro-vaping voice on social media in the pre-COVID-19 period. Continued monitoring of social media conversations around vaping is needed, and the public health community may consider using social media platforms to actively convey scientific information around vaping and vaping cessation.

  abstract  = {Social media provides an opportunity for many individuals to express their emotions online. Automatically classifying user emotions can help us understand the preferences of the general public, which has a number of useful applications, including sentiment retrieval and opinion summarization. Short text is prevalent on the Web, especially in tweets, questions, and news headlines. Most of the existing social emotion classification models focus on the detection of user emotions conveyed by long documents. In this paper, we introduce a multi-label maximum entropy (MME) model for user emotion classification over short text. MME generates rich features by modeling multiple emotion labels and valence scored by numerous users jointly. To improve the robustness of the method on varied-scale corpora, we further develop a co-training algorithm for MME and use the L-BFGS algorithm for the generalized MME model. Experiments on real-world short text collections validate the effectiveness of these methods on social emotion classification over sparse features. We also demonstrate the application of generated lexicons in identifying entities and behaviors that convey different social emotions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  doi       = {10.1016/j.artmed.2019.101767},
  abstract  = {Background and objective: Question answering (QA), the identification of short accurate answers to users questions written in natural language expressions, is a longstanding issue widely studied over the last decades in the open-domain. However, it still remains a real challenge in the biomedical domain as the most of the existing systems support a limited amount of question and answer types as well as still require further efforts in order to improve their performance in terms of precision for the supported questions. Here, we present a semantic biomedical QA system named SemBioNLQA which has the ability to handle the kinds of yes/no, factoid, list, and summary natural language questions. Methods: This paper describes the system architecture and an evaluation of the developed end-to-end biomedical QA system named SemBioNLQA, which consists of question classification, document retrieval, passage retrieval and answer extraction modules. It takes natural language questions as input, and outputs both short precise answers and summaries as results. The SemBioNLQA system, dealing with four types of questions, is based on (1) handcrafted lexico-syntactic patterns and a machine learning algorithm for question classification, (2) PubMed search engine and UMLS similarity for document retrieval, (3) the BM25 model, stemmed words and UMLS concepts for passage retrieval, and (4) UMLS metathesaurus, BioPortal synonyms, sentiment analysis and term frequency metric for answer extraction. Results and conclusion: Compared with the current state-of-the-art biomedical QA systems, SemBioNLQA, a fully automated system, has the potential to deal with a large amount of question and answer types. SemBioNLQA retrieves quickly users’ information needs by returning exact answers (e.g., “yes”, “no”, a biomedical entity name, etc.) and ideal answers (i.e., paragraph-sized summaries of relevant information) for yes/no, factoid and list questions, whereas it provides only the ideal answers for summary questions. Moreover, experimental evaluations performed on biomedical questions and answers provided by the BioASQ challenge especially in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (as part of our participation), show that SemBioNLQA achieves good performances compared with the most current state-of-the-art systems and allows a practical and competitive alternative to help information seekers find exact and ideal answers to their biomedical questions.

A web analytics-based approach is proposed to conduct in-depth analyses of the data extracted from such websites and generate meaningful insights. A combination of sentiment analysis and topic modeling through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation and machine learning algorithm is used for analyzing the data. The application of the proposed model is illustrated in the case of Goa, India. Findings reveal that the lack of cleanliness, safety, parking, price, facilities, and services are pertinent topics leading to negative sentiments. These topics also corroborate the social and economic events that took place during the period of study. Further clustering of tourist destinations across Goa reveals the presence of similar dissatisfiers. The above findings can be used for deciding the strategy for remedial action by relevant stakeholders. Moreover, the model can automatically classify and analyze future reviews in real-time.

  title     = {Validating automated sentiment analysis of online cognitive behavioral therapy patient texts: An exploratory study.},
  doi       = {10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01065},
  abstract  = {Introduction: Sentiment analysis may be a useful technique to derive a user’s emotional state from free text input, allowing for more empathic automated feedback in online cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) interventions for psychological disorders such as depression. As guided iCBT is considered more effective than unguided iCBT, such automated feedback may help close the gap between the two. The accuracy of automated sentiment analysis is domain dependent, and it is unclear how well the technology is applicable to iCBT. This paper presents an empirical study in which automated sentiment analysis by an algorithm for the Dutch language is validated against human judgment. Methods: A total of 493 iCBT user texts were evaluated on overall sentiment and the presence of five specific emotions by an algorithm, and by 52 psychology students who evaluated 75 randomly selected texts each, providing about eight human evaluations per text. Inter-rater agreement (IRR) between algorithm and humans, and humans among each other, was analyzed by calculating the intra-class correlation under a numerical interpretation of the data, and Cohen’s kappa, and Krippendorff’s alpha under a categorical interpretation. Results: All analyses indicated moderate agreement between the algorithm and average human judgment with respect to evaluating overall sentiment, and low agreement for the specific emotions. Somewhat surprisingly, the same was the case for the IRR among human judges, which means that the algorithm performed about as well as a randomly selected human judge. Thus, considering average human judgment as a benchmark for the applicability of automated sentiment analysis, the technique can be considered for practical application. Discussion/Conclusion: The low human-human agreement on the presence of emotions may be due to the nature of the texts, it may simply be difficult for humans to agree on the presence of the selected emotions, or perhaps trained therapists would have reached more consensus. Future research may focus on validating the algorithm against a more solid benchmark, on applying the algorithm in an application in which empathic feedback is provided, for example, by an embodied conversational agent, or on improving the algorithm for the iCBT domain with a bottom-up machine learning approach.

  doi       = {10.1007/s12559-017-9477-1},
  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis is considered as one of the recent applications of text categorization that categories the emotions expressed in text as negative, positive, and natural. Rough set theory is a mathematical tool used to analyze uncertainty, incomplete information, and data reduction. Indiscernibility, reduct, and core are essential concepts in rough set theory that can be employed for data classification and knowledge reduction. This paper proposes to use the rough set-based methods for sentiment analysis to classify tweets that are written in the Arabic language. The paper investigates the application of the reduct concept of rough set theory as a feature selection method for sentiment analysis. This paper investigates four reduct computation techniques to generate the set of reducts. For classification purposes, two rule generation algorithms have been studied to build the rough set rule-based classifier. An Arabic data set of 4800 tweets is used in the experiments to validate the use of reduct computation for Arabic sentiment analysis. The results of the experiments showed that using rough set reducts techniques lead to different results and some of them can perform better than non-rough set classifier. The best classification accuracy rate was for rough set classifier using the full attribute weighting reduct generation algorithm which achieved an accuracy of 74%. The primary results indicate that using the rough set theory framework for sentiment analysis is an appealing option where it can enhance the overall accuracy and reduce the number of used terms for classification which in turn will lead to a faster classification process, especially with a large dataset.

  doi       = {10.1007/s12559-015-9319-y},
  abstract  = {Text classification often faces the problem of imbalanced training data. This is true in sentiment analysis and particularly prominent in emotion classification where multiple emotion categories are very likely to produce naturally skewed training data. Different sampling methods have been proposed to improve classification performance by reducing the imbalance ratio between training classes. However, data sparseness and the small disjunct problem remain obstacles in generating new samples for minority classes when the data are skewed and limited. Methods to produce meaningful samples for smaller classes rather than simple duplication are essential in overcoming this problem. In this paper, we present an oversampling method based on word embedding compositionality which produces meaningful balanced training data. We first use a large corpus to train a continuous skip-gram model to form a word embedding model maintaining the syntactic and semantic integrity of the word features. Then, a compositional algorithm based on recursive neural tensor networks is used to construct sentence vectors based on the word embedding model. Finally, we use the SMOTE algorithm as an oversampling method to generate samples for the minority classes and produce a fully balanced training set. Evaluation results on two quite different tasks show that the feature composition method and the oversampling method are both important in obtaining improved classification results. Our method effectively addresses the data imbalance issue and consequently achieves improved results for both sentiment and emotion classification.

  title     = {On measuring social dynamics of online social media.},
  abstract  = {Due to the complex nature of human behaviour and to our inability to directly measure thoughts and feelings, social psychology has long struggled for empirical grounding for its theories and models. Traditional techniques involving groups of people in controlled environments are limited to small numbers and may not be a good analogue for real social interactions in natural settings due to their controlled and artificial nature. Their application as a foundation for simulation of social processes suffers similarly. The proliferation of online social media offers new opportunities to observe social phenomena “in the wild” that have only just begun to be realised. To date, analysis of social media data has been largely focussed on specific, commercially relevant goals (such as sentiment analysis) that are of limited use to social psychology, and the dynamics critical to an understanding of social processes is rarely addressed or even present in collected data. This thesis addresses such shortfalls by: (i) presenting a novel data collection strategy and system for rich dynamic data from communities operating on Twitter; (ii) a data set encompassing longitudinal dynamic information over two and a half years from the online pro-ana (pro-anorexia) movement; and (iii) two approaches to identifying active social psychological processes in collections of online text and network metadata: an approach linking traditional psychometric studies with topic models and an algorithm combining community detection in user networks with topic models of the social media text they generate, enabling identification of community specific topic usage.

  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis is about classifying opinions expressed in text. The aim of this study is to improve polarity classification of sentiments in microblogs by building adaptive sentiment lexicons. In the proposed method, corpora-based and lexicon-based approaches are combined and lexicons are generated from text. The sentiment classification is formulated as an optimization problem, in which the goal is to find optimum sentiment lexicons. A novel genetic algorithm is then proposed to solve this optimization problem and find lexicons to classify text. The algorithm generates adaptive sentiment lexicons, and then a meta-level feature is extracted based on it, which is then used alongside Bing Liu's lexicon and n-gram features. The experiments are conducted on six datasets. In terms of accuracy, the results outperform the state-of-the-art methods proposed in the literature in two of the datasets. Also, in four of the datasets, the proposed approach outperforms in terms of F-measure. Applying the proposed method on six datasets, the accuracy is higher than 80% in all six datasets and the F-measure is higher than 80% in four of these datasets. Using the sentiment lexicons created by the proposed algorithm, one can get a better understanding of the specific language and culture of Twitter users and sentiment orientation of words in different contexts. It is also shown that it is useful not to omit the conventional stop-words, as each word can have its sentimental implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {The lexicon-based approaches to opinion mining involve the extraction of term polarities from sentiment lexicons and the aggregation of such scores to predict the overall sentiment of a piece of text. It is typically preferred where sentiment labelled data is difficult to obtain or algorithm robustness across different domains is essential. A major challenge for this approach is accounting for the semantic gap between prior polarities of terms captured by a lexicon and the terms’ polarities in a specific context (contextual polarity). This is further exacerbated by the fact that a term’s contextual polarity also depends on domains or genres in which it appears. In this paper, we introduce SMARTSA, a lexicon-based sentiment classification system for social media genres which integrates strategies to capture contextual polarity from two perspectives: the interaction of terms with their textual neighbourhood (local context) and text genre (global context). We introduce an approach to hybridise a general purpose lexicon, SentiWordNet, with genre-specific vocabulary and sentiment. Evaluation results from diverse social media show that our strategies to account for local and global contexts significantly improve sentiment classification, and are complementary in combination. Our system also performed significantly better than a state-of-the-art sentiment classification system for social media, SENTISTRENGTH. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

In this work, we study the question of local decision making in an IML context around feature selection for a sentiment classification task. Specifically, we characterize the utility of interactive feature selection through a combination of human-subjects experiments and computational simulations. We find that, in expectation, interactive modification fails to improve model performance and may hamper generalization due to overfitting. We examine how these trends are affected by the dataset, learning algorithm, and the training set size. Across these factors we observe consistent generalization issues. Our results suggest that rapid iterations with IML systems can be dangerous if they encourage local actions divorced from global context, degrading overall model performance. We conclude by discussing the implications of our feature selection results to the broader area of IML systems and research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  doi       = {10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2705691},
  abstract  = {Although the concept of user experience includes two key aspects, experience of meaning (usability) and experience of emotion (affect), the empirical work that measures both the usability and affective aspects of user experience is currently limited. This is particularly important considering that affect could significantly influence a user’s perception of usability. This paper uses image schemas to quantitatively and systematically evaluate both these aspects. It proposes a method for evaluating user experience that is based on using image schemas, sentiment analysis, and computational semantics. The aim is to link the sentiments expressed by users during their interactions with a product to the specific image schemas used in the designs. The method involves semantic and sentiment analysis of the verbal responses of the users to identify (i) task-related words linked to the task for which a certain image schema has been used and (ii) affect-related words associated with the image schema employed in the interaction. The main contribution is in linking image schemas with interaction and affect. The originality of the method is twofold. First, it uses a domain-specific ontology of image schemas specifically developed for the needs of this study. Second, it employs a novel ontology-based algorithm that extracts the image schemas employed by the user to complete a specific task and identifies and links the sentiments expressed by the user with the specific image schemas used in the task. The proposed method is evaluated using a case study involving 40 participants who completed a set task with two different products. The results show that the method successfully links the users’ experiences to the specific image schemas employed to complete the task. This method facilitates significant improvements in product design practices and usability studies in particular, as it allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation of designs by identifying specific image schemas and product design features that have been positively or negatively received by the users. This allows user experience to be assessed in a systematic way, which leads to a better understanding of the value associated with particular design features.

  title     = {Interpersonal communication analysis with facial expression encoding and interactional modeling.},
  abstract  = {In this thesis, I design and validate a computational framework to improve understanding of facial expressions in honest and deceptive communication. As part of this framework, I developed the Automatic Dyadic Data Recorder (ADDR) - an online, scalable, crowd-sourced system that automates much of the work in conducting pairwise communication studies. The system recruits participants from a job crowd-sourcing platform, certifies that their computer environment is able to engage in high quality video, links two participants through video chat, and directs the two participants through the individual steps of a communication study protocol involving deception. We used ADDR to create the largest public database of 674 videos ( > 65 hours of total video, > 5000 questions and answers) involving deception. The data from this study enabled the development of several computational models.1) A smile encoder based on a modified beta-mixture model. This encoder revealed 9 fundamental smile types in interpersonal communication and improved deception detection accuracy from 56.8% to 64.9%. This encoder also revealed that an exaggerated smile using both the eyes and mouth is expressed more often in deceptive witnesses, and is also used more often by successful speed daters. 2) Motivated by the interpersonal nature of nonverbal communication, an algorithm was developed to recalibrate eye gaze signals from a relative to the camera format to a relative to your conversation partner format. The interpersonal calibration improved deception classification based on eye gaze from 55.4% to 66.0%.3) In order to capture the dynamic components of facial expressions, a dynamic model based on an LSTM architecture was developed to distinguish faces associated with imagining vs. remembering (e.g., a specific object, place, or event). This model improved our deception detection accuracy to 70%, significantly outperforming the human performance of 52%. 4) Recognizing the contextual significance of facial expression, three multimodal models were also developed, analyzing facial expressions in the context of word semantics, textual sentiment, and gender divergence. These multimodal models not only outperformed their unimodal counterparts, but also interestingly identified situations in which unimodal models identify starkly different correlations between a given facial expression type and its relation to higher level behavior - perhaps explaining some of the contradictory conclusions different studies have regarding facial expression. This thesis also addresses the ethical implications of advancing technologies that may unmask an individual's internal feelings without their consent, and provides recommendations to lawmakers of a "mental trespass" law to avoid misuse. Findings from this thesis were successfully used to model patient-doctor communication for final stage cancer patients as well as screening for the facial expression changes associated with diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease.

  abstract  = {Twitter has become exceedingly popular, with hundreds of millions of tweets being posted every day on a wide variety of topics. This has helped make real-time search applications possible with leading search engines routinely displaying relevant tweets in response to user queries. Recent research has shown that a considerable fraction of these tweets are about “events,” and the detection of novel events in the tweet-stream has attracted a lot of research interest. However, very little research has focused on properly displaying this real-time information about events. For instance, the leading search engines simply display all tweets matching the queries in reverse chronological order. Online content exhibits rich temporal dynamics, and diverse real-time user generated content further intensifies this process. However, temporal patterns by which online content grows and fades over time, and by which different pieces of content compete for attention remain largely unexplored. This article describes tracking and analyzing public sentiment on social networks and finding the possible reasons causing these variations. It is important to find the decision from public views and opinion in different domain. They can be used to discover special topics or aspects in one text collection in comparison with another background text collection. The implemented method attains the 95% accuracy while predict the sentiments from the social websites and the 96.3% of the opinion rate with minimum time.

  title     = {Sarcasm identification in textual data: Systematic review, research challenges and open directions.},
  doi       = {10.1007/s10462-019-09791-8},
  abstract  = {Sarcasm is a form of sentiment whereby people express the implicit information, usually the opposite of the message content in order to hurt someone emotionally or criticise something in a humorous way. Sarcasm identification in textual data, being one of the hardest challenges in natural language processing (NLP), has recently become an interesting research area due to its importance in improving the sentiment analysis of social media data. A few studies have carried out a comprehensive literature review on sarcasm identification in the existing primary study within the last 11 years. Thus, this study carried out a review on the classification techniques for sarcasm identification under the aspects of datasets, pre-processing, feature engineering, classification algorithms, and performance metrics. The study has considered the published article from the period of 2008 to 2019. Forty (40) academic literature were selected from the 7 standard academic databases in order to carry out the review and realize the objectives. The study revealed that most researchers created their own datasets since there is no standard available datasets in the domain of sarcasm identification. Context and content-based linguistic features were used in most of the studies. This review shows that n-gram and parts of speech tagging techniques were the most commonly used feature extraction techniques. However, binary representation and term frequency were utilized for feature representation whereas Chi squared and information gain were used for the feature selection scheme. Moreover, classification algorithm such as support vector machine, Naïve Bayes, random forest, maximum entropy, and decision tree algorithm were mostly applied using accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure for performance measures. Finally, research challenges and future direction are summarized in this review. This review reveals the impact of sarcasm identification in building effective product reviews and would serve as handle resources for researchers and practitioners in sarcasm identification and text classification in general.

  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0260761},
  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis is a branch of natural language analytics that aims to correlate what is expressed which comes normally within unstructured format with what is believed and learnt. Several attempts have tried to address this gap (i.e., Naive Bayes, RNN, LSTM, word embedding, etc.), even though the deep learning models achieved high performance, their generative process remains a "black-box" and not fully disclosed due to the high dimensional feature and the non-deterministic weights assignment. Meanwhile, graphs are becoming more popular when modeling complex systems while being traceable and understood. Here, we reveal that a good trade-off transparency and efficiency could be achieved with a Deep Neural Network by exploring the Credit Assignment Paths theory. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm which alleviates the features' extraction mechanism and attributes an importance level of selected neurons by applying a deterministic edge/node embeddings with attention scores on the input unit and backward path respectively. We experiment on the Twitter Health News dataset were the model has been extended to approach different approximations (tweet/aspect and tweets' source levels, frequency, polarity/subjectivity), it was also transparent and traceable. Moreover, results of comparing with four recent models on same data corpus for tweets analysis showed a rapid convergence with an overall accuracy of ≈83% and 94% of correctly identified true positive sentiments. Therefore, weights can be ideally assigned to specific active features by following the proposed method. As opposite to other compared works, the inferred features are conditioned through the users' preferences (i.e., frequency degree) and via the activation's derivatives (i.e., reject feature if not scored). Future direction will address the inductive aspect of graph embeddings to include dynamic graph structures and expand the model resiliency by considering other datasets like SemEval task7, covid-19 tweets, etc. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  title     = {Assessing electronic cigarette-related tweets for sentiment and content using supervised machine learning.},
  doi       = {10.2196/jmir.4392},
  abstract  = {Background: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) continue to be a growing topic among social media users, especially on Twitter. The ability to analyze conversations about e-cigarettes in real-time can provide important insight into trends in the public’s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs surrounding e-cigarettes, and subsequently guide public health interventions. Objective: Our aim was to establish a supervised machine learning algorithm to build predictive classification models that assess Twitter data for a range of factors related to e-cigarettes. Methods: Manual content analysis was conducted for 17,098 tweets. These tweets were coded for five categories: e-cigarette relevance, sentiment, user description, genre, and theme. Machine learning classification models were then built for each of these five categories, and word groupings (n-grams) were used to define the feature space for each classifier. Results: Predictive performance scores for classification models indicated that the models correctly labeled the tweets with the appropriate variables between 68.40% and 99.34% of the time, and the percentage of maximum possible improvement over a random baseline that was achieved by the classification models ranged from 41.59% to 80.62%. Classifiers with the highest performance scores that also achieved the highest percentage of the maximum possible improvement over a random baseline were Policy/Government (performance: 0.94; % improvement: 80.62%), Relevance (performance: 0.94; % improvement: 75.26%), Ad or Promotion (performance: 0.89; % improvement: 72.69%), and Marketing (performance: 0.91; % improvement: 72.56%). The most appropriate word-grouping unit (n-gram) was 1 for the majority of classifiers. Performance continued to marginally increase with the size of the training dataset of manually annotated data, but eventually leveled off. Even at low dataset sizes of 4000 observations, performance characteristics were fairly sound. Conclusions: Social media outlets like Twitter can uncover real-time snapshots of personal sentiment, knowledge, attitudes, and behavior that are not as accessible, at this scale, through any other offline platform. Using the vast data available through social media presents an opportunity for social science and public health methodologies to utilize computational methodologies to enhance and extend research and practice. This study was successful in automating a complex five-category manual content analysis of e-cigarette-related content on Twitter using machine learning techniques. The study details machine learning model specifications that provided the best accuracy for data related to e-cigarettes, as well as a replicable methodology to allow extension of these methods to additional topics.

  doi       = {10.1111/exsy.12527},
  abstract  = {One of the main benefits of unsupervised learning is that there is no need for labelled data. As a method of this category, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) estimates the semantic relations between the words of the text effectively and can play an important role in solving various issues, including emotional analysis in combination with other parameters. In this study, three novel topic models called date sentiment LDA (DSLDA), author-date sentiment LDA (ADSLDA), and pack-author-date sentiment LDA (PADSLDA) are proposed. The proposed models extend LDA through some extra parameters such as date, author, helpfulness, sentiment, and subtopic. The proposed models use helpfulness in the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Helpfulness is a part of readers who found the review helpful. The proposed models divide the words into two categories: the words more affected by the distribution of subtopic and the words more affected by the main topic. In this study, a new concept called pack is introduced, and a new model called PADSLDA is proposed for sentiment analysis at pack level. The proposed models outperformed the baseline models because according to evaluations results, the extra parameters can appropriately affect the generating process of words in a review. Sentiment analysis at the document level, perplexity, and topic coherence are the main parameters used in the evaluations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {Annotations are critical in various text mining tasks such as opinion mining, sentiment analysis, word sense disambiguation. Supervised learning algorithms start with the training of the classifier and require manually annotated datasets. However, manual annotations are often subjective, biased, onerous, and burdensome to develop; therefore, there is a need for automatic annotation. Automatic annotators automatically annotate the data for creating the training set for the supervised classifier, but lack subjectivity and ignore semantics of underlying textual structures. The objective of this research is to develop scalable and semantically rich automatic annotation system while incorporating domain dependent characteristics of the annotation process. The authors devised an enhanced bootstrapping algorithm for the automatic annotation of Tweets and employed distributional semantic models (LSA and Word2Vec) to augment the novel Bootstrapping algorithm and tested the proposed algorithm on the 12,000 crowd-sourced annotated Tweets and achieved a 68.56% accuracy which is higher than the baseline accuracy.

  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis from unstructured natural language text has recently received considerable attention from the research community. In the frame of biologically inspired machine learning approaches, finding good feature sets is particularly challenging yet very important. In this paper, we focus on this fundamental issue of the sentiment analysis task. Specifically, we employ concepts as features and present a concept extraction algorithm based on a novel concept parser scheme to extract semantic features that exploit semantic relationships between words in natural language text. Additional conceptual information of a concept is obtained using the ConceptNet ontology: Concepts extracted from text are sent as queries to ConceptNet to extract their semantics. We select important concepts and eliminate redundant concepts using the Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance feature selection technique. All selected concepts are then used to build a machine learning model that classifies a given document as positive or negative. We evaluate our concept extraction approach using a benchmark movie review dataset provided by Cornell University and product review datasets on books, DVDs, and electronics. Comparative experimental results show that our proposed approach to sentiment analysis outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  title     = {Structured microblog sentiment classification via social context regularization.},
  doi       = {10.1016/j.neucom.2015.10.101},
  abstract  = {Microblog sentiment analysis is a fundamental problem for many interesting applications. Existing microblog sentiment classification methods judge the sentiment polarity mainly according to textual content. However, since microblog messages are very short and noisy, and their sentiment polarities are often ambiguous and context-dependent, the accuracy of microblog sentiment classification is usually unsatisfactory. Fortunately, microblog messages lie in social media and contain rich social contexts. The social context information often implies sentiment connections between microblog messages. For example, a microblogging user usually expresses the same sentiment when posting multiple messages towards the same topic. Motivated by these observations, in this paper we propose a structured microblog sentiment classification (SMSC) framework. Our framework can combine social context information with textual content information to improve microblog sentiment classification accuracy. Two kinds of social contexts are used in our framework, i.e., social connections between microblog messages brought by the same author and social connections brought by social relations between users. In our framework, social context information is formulated as the graph structure over the sentiments of microblog messages. The objective function of our framework is a tradeoff between the agreement with content-based sentiment predictions and the consistency with social contexts. An efficient optimization algorithm is introduced to solve our framework. Experimental results on two Twitter sentiment analysis benchmark datasets indicate that our method can outperform baseline methods consistently and significantly.

  abstract  = {As public discourse continues to progress online, it is important for mental health advocates, public health officials, and other curious parties and stakeholders, ranging from researchers, to those affected by the issue, to be aware of the advancing new mediums in which the public can share content ranging from useful resources and self-help tips to personal struggles with respect to both illness and its stigmatization. A better understanding of this new public discourse on mental health, often framed as social media campaigns, can help perpetuate the allocation of sparse mental health resources, the need for educational awareness, and the usefulness of community, with an opportunity to reach those seeking help at the right moment. The objective of this study was to understand the nature of and engagement around mental health content shared on mental health campaigns, specifically #MyTipsForMentalHealth on Twitter around World Mental Health Awareness Day in 2017. We collected 14,217 Twitter posts from 10,805 unique users between September and October 2017 that contained the hashtag #MyTipsForMentalHealth. With the involvement of domain experts, we hand-labeled 700 posts and categorized them as (a) Fact, (b) Stigmatizing, (c) Inspirational, (d) Medical/Clinical Tip, (e) Resource Related, (f) Lifestyle or Social Tip or Personal View, and (g) Off Topic. After creating a “seed” machine learning classifier, we used both unsupervised and semi supervised methods to classify posts into the various expert identified topical categories. We also performed a content analysis to understand how information on different topics spread through social networks. Our support vector machine classification algorithm achieved a mean cross-validation accuracy of 0.81 and accuracy of 0.64 on unseen data. We found that inspirational Twitter posts were the most spread with a mean of 4.17 retweets, and stigmatizing content was second with a mean of 3.66 retweets. Classification of social media-related mental health interactions offers valuable insights on public sentiment as well as a window into the evolving world of online self-help and the varied resources within. Our results suggest an important role for social media-based peer support to not only guide information seekers to useful content and local resources but also illuminate the socially-insular aspects of stigmatization. However, our results also reflect the challenges of quantifying the heterogeneity of mental health content on social media and the need for novel machine learning methods customized to the challenges of the field.

  title     = {Exploring expectancy violations and emotions in computer-mediated communication: A mixed method, hybrid approach to content analysis of online mental health messages.},
  abstract  = {The purpose of this research was to explore expectancy violations and emotional features of online mental health messages utilizing a mixed-method, hybrid human coded and computer coded approach to content analysis. Scholarship that explores the genesis and prevalence of mental health illnesses typically investigate cognitive variables such as thwarted belonging, perceived burden, hopelessness, defeat, and entrapment. However, emotional states have long been implicated in contributing to suicide risk, as well as clinical depression, anxiety, and other mental health-related mood disorders. Moreover, involvement in computer-mediated communication (CMC) platforms encourages both empowering and disempowering processes among individuals coping with mental health illness, and the emotional experience is at the crux of these interactions prompting possible increased engagement. Given that CMC is a novel space to study social interactions, and the role of emotion in communication is still largely blurred in this context, studies investigating emotion message features and its impact on our online interactions is warranted. The research aimed to address two overarching questions: What are the expectancy violation and emotion features of mental health messages shared in computer-mediated communication and 2) How do emotion message features influence social media response behaviors? Mental health narratives disseminated online, and their associated Facebook posts, were analyzed and a series of content analyses studies were done employing Grounded Theory methodology, hierarchical regression, textual sentiment analyses and an unsupervised learning algorithm in the R programming language. An integrated theoretical model guided by the Emotional Broadcaster Theory, Expectancy Violations Theory, and the Elaboration Likelihood Model was used to explore and identify the factors of expectancy violations, emotion, and additional linguistic message variables that prompt social media engagement, thereby promoting information contagion of mental health messages. Results provided insight into the violation experiences of those suffering from mental health illness. Findings additionally enhance our current understanding of the impact of emotion features on computer-mediated communication. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {A recommender system is an information filtering technology that can be used to recommend items that may be of interest to users. Additionally, there are the context‐aware recommender systems that consider contextual information to generate the recommendations. Reviews can provide relevant information that can be used by recommender systems, including contextual and opinion information. In a previous work, we proposed a context‐aware recommendation method based on text mining (CARM‐TM). The method includes two techniques to extract context from reviews: CIET.5embed, a technique based on word embeddings; and RulesContext, a technique based on association rules. In this work, we have extended our previous method by including CEOM, a new technique which extracts context by using aspect‐based opinions. We call our extension of CARM‐TOM (context‐aware recommendation method based on text and opinion mining). To generate recommendations, our method makes use of the CAMF algorithm, a context‐aware recommender based on matrix factorization. To evaluate CARM‐TOM, we ran an extensive set of experiments in a dataset about restaurants, comparing CARM‐TOM against the MF algorithm, an uncontextual recommender system based on matrix factorization; and against a context extraction method proposed in literature. The empirical results strongly indicate that our method is able to improve a context‐aware recommender system. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {With the rapid growth of social networks, mining customer opinions based on online reviews is crucial to understand consumer needs. Due to the richness of language expressions, customer opinions are often expressed implicitly. However, previous studies usually focus on mining explicit opinions to understand consumer needs. In this paper, we propose a novel implicit opinion analysis model to perform implicit opinion analysis of Chinese customer reviews at both the feature and review levels. First, we extract an implicit-opinionated review/clause dataset from raw review dataset and introduce the concept of the feature-based implicit opinion pattern (FBIOP). Secondly, we develop a clustering algorithm to construct product feature categories. Based on the constructed feature categories, FBIOPs can be mined from the extracted implicit-opinionated clause dataset. Thirdly, the sentiment intensity and polarity of each FBIOP are calculated by using the Chi squared test and pointwise mutual information. Fourthly, according to the resulting FBIOP polarities, the polarities of implicit opinions can be determined at both the feature and review levels. Car forum reviews written in Chinese are collected and labeled as the experimental dataset. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional support vector machine model and the cutting-edge convolutional neural network model.

In this paper we look at one commonly used framing device for linguistic irony--the simile--to show how even the most creative uses of irony are often marked in ways that make them computationally feasible to detect. We conduct a very large corpus analysis of web-harvested similes to identify the most interesting characteristics of ironic comparisons, and provide an empirical evaluation of a new algorithm for separating ironic from non-ironic similes.

The results are presented and discussed on the basis of 4 datasets from different product universes: chocolates, perfumes and wines.

  title     = {Biases as values: Evaluating algorithms in context.},
  abstract  = {This dissertation asks how researchers can create more equitable algorithmic systems. Ultimately, this thesis explores methods and implications of representing subjects of analysis in the design and evaluation of algorithmic systems. I also unpack how algorithmic tools measure and quantify human behavior, giving heed to the potential impacts of these systems on underrepresented communities. Building off of current work in HCI and algorithmic fairness, my research raises questions about how we can evaluate algorithms to understand the contexts and communities they serve best. The data sets and survey data used in this research are available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/algorithm-age-bias/. Because algorithmic tools are often created using data processed in similar ways (e.g., using one of a few common, publicly available data sets, or generating training annotations exclusively through crowd work platforms), these tools can fail to capture data and patterns that reflect underrepresented groups. The result can be unintended algorithmic bias. I use mixed methods-- both quantitative and qualitative-- to explore the broader social contexts in which algorithmic tools are applied and test methods of mitigating unintended algorithmic bias---one of which directly involves subjects of analysis in the creation and evaluation of an algorithmic tool.In my first study I systematically analyze the outputs of popular sentiment models for age bias. I find a tendency for text to be rated more negatively when it references older age, then I develop an approach to removing bias rooted in training data. Taking older adults as a stakeholder group to prioritize in the face of age bias, I next solicit data annotations from older adults to evaluate model performance against their expertise on age and aging. A new model built from this data replicates age bias of similar magnitude to bias in my initial analysis and raises questions about the influence of annotator social identity and beliefs on model performance. In the final study I complement quantitative approaches to model assessment and turn to qualitative methods to evaluate model objective functions using direct input from algorithm stakeholders. Ultimately, I argue that the development of ethical algorithmic tools must involve input from the very individuals who will be analyzed and impacted by system deployment.

  abstract  = {With the continuous development of social networks, Weibo has become an essential platform for people to share their opinions and feelings in daily life. Analysis of users' emotional tendencies can be effectively applied to public opinion control, public opinion surveys, and product recommendations. However, the traditional deep learning algorithm often needs a large amount of data to be retained to obtain a better accuracy when faced with new work tasks. Given this situation, a multiclassification method of microblog negative sentiment based on MAML (model-agnostic metalearning) and BiLSTM (bidirectional extended short-term memory network) is proposed to represent the microblog text word vectorization and the combination of MAML and BiLSTM is constructed. The model of BiLSTM realizes the classification of negative emotions on Weibo and updates the parameters through machine gradient descent; the metalearner in MAML calculates the sum of the losses of multiple pieces of training, performs a second gradient descent, and updates the metalearner parameters. The updated metalearner can quickly iterate when faced with a new Weibo negative sentiment classification task. The experimental results show that compared with the prepopular model, on the Weibo negative sentiment dataset, the precision rate, recall rate, and F1 value are increased by 1.68 percentage points, 2.86 percentage points, and 2.27 percentage points, respectively.

  doi       = {10.1007/s12559-021-09929-3},
  abstract  = {Background: Sentiment analysis (SA) has turned out to be a new pattern in social networking, avidly helping people to realize views expressed in user-generated content and conventional platforms of social media. For performing numerous social media analytics tasks, SA of online user-produced content is vital. The performance of the sentiment classifiers utilizing a single modality, i.e., visual or textual, is still not matured because of the wide variety of data platforms. Methods: In this paper, we propose a new framework called VIsual-TExtual SA (VITESA) that carries out visual analysis and textual analysis for polarity classification. In the VITESA framework, Brownian Movement-based Meerkat Clan Algorithm-centered DenseNet (BMMCA-DenseNet) is proposed that integrates textual and visual information for robust SA. In the visual phase, the images that are in the Flickr dataset are taken as input, and the operations: (1) preprocessing (2) feature extraction, and (3) feature selection utilizing Improved Coyote Optimization Algorithm (ICOA) are executed. In the textual phase, the user comments as of the Twitter dataset are taken as input, and the operations: (1) preprocessing (2) word embedding using adaptive Embedding for Language Models (ELMo), (3) emoticon and non-emoticon feature extraction, and SentiWordNet polarity assignment is carried out. The final stages of both phases are given as input to the proposed BMMCA-DenseNet classifier and intended to categorize the data into positive and negative polarity. The performance of BMMCA-DenseNet is compared with certain existing algorithms, and various performance metrics are evaluated. Results: The proposed BMMCA-DenseNet classifier performs the polarity classification of the visual-textual data into two classes: positive or negative. The classifier categorizes the polarity of visual-textual data comprising 97% of accuracy, 94.44% of precision, 94.41% of recall, 94.41% of F-measure, 91.75% of Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient, 94.43% of sensitivity, 97.13% of specificity, and also minimal error. Conclusions: The experiment is performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The outcomes exhibit that BMMCA-DenseNet attains remarkable performance over other existing techniques. The result enhances the textual-visual communication systematically to improve sentiment prediction utilizing both information sources. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis in natural language text is a challenging task involving a deep understanding of both syntax and semantics. Leveraging the polarity of multiword expressions--or concepts--rather than single words can mitigate the difficulty of such a task as these expressions carry more contextual information than isolated words. Such contextual information is the key to understanding both the syntactic and semantic structure of natural language text and hence is useful in tasks such as sentiment analysis. In this work, we propose a new method to enrich SenticNet (a publicly available knowledge base for concept-level sentiment analysis) with domain-level concepts composed of aspects and sentiment word pairs, along with a measure of their polarity. We process a set of unlabeled texts and, by considering the statistical co-occurrence information, generate a direct acyclic graph (DAG) of concepts. The polarity score of known concepts is propagated and used to compute polarity scores of new concepts. By designing and implementing our exhaustive algorithm, we are able to use a seed set containing only two sentiment words (good and bad). In our evaluation conducted on a dataset of hotel reviews, SenticNet was enriched by a factor of three (from 30,000 to nearly 90,000 concepts). The experiments demonstrate the merit of the concepts discovered by our method at improving sentence-level and aspect-level sentiment analysis tasks. Results of the two-factor ANOVA statistical test showed a confidence level of 95 %, verifying that the improvements are statistically significant.

  abstract  = {Gathering public opinions on the Internet and Internet-based applications like Twitter has become popular in recent times, as it provides decision-makers with uncensored public views on products, government policies, and programs. Through natural language processing and machine learning techniques, unstructured data forms from these sources can be analyzed using traditional statistical learning. The challenge encountered in machine learning method-based sentiment classification still remains the abundant amount of data available, which makes it difficult to train the learning algorithms in feasible time. This eventually degrades the classification accuracy of the algorithms. From this assertion, the effect of training data sizes in classification tasks cannot be overemphasized. This study statistically assessed the performance of Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest algorithms on sentiment text classification task. The research also investigated the optimal conditions such as varying data sizes, trees, and kernel types under which each of the respective algorithms performed best. The study collected Twitter data from Ghanaian users which contained sentiments about the Ghanaian Government. The data was preprocessed, manually labeled by the researcher, and then trained using the aforementioned algorithms. These algorithms are three of the most popular learning algorithms which have had lots of success in diverse fields. The Naive Bayes classifier was adjudged the best algorithm for the task as it outperformed the other two machine learning algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, F1 score of 86.51%, and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9906. The algorithm also performed well with increasing data sizes. The Naive Bayes classifier is recommended as viable for sentiment text classification, especially for text classification systems which work with Big Data.

  doi       = {10.1155/2020/2860479},
  abstract  = {Sentimental analysis aims at inferring how people express their opinion over any piece of text or topic of interest. This article deals with detection of an implicit form of the sentiment, referred to as sarcasm. Sarcasm conveys the opposite of what people try to convey in order to criticize or ridicule in a humorous way. It plays a vital role in social networks since most of the tweets or posts contain sarcastic nuances. Existing approaches towards the study of sarcasm deals only with the detection of sarcasm. In this paper, in addition to detecting sarcasm from text, an approach has been proposed to identify the type of sarcasm. ,e main motivation behind determining the types of sarcasm is to identify the level of hurt or the true intent behind the sarcastic text. The proposed work aims to improve upon the existing approaches by incorporating a new perspective which classifies the sarcasm based on the level of harshness employed. The major application of the proposed work would be relating the emotional state of a person to the type of sarcasm exhibited by him/her which could provide major insights about the emotional behavior of a person. An ensemble-based feature selection method has been proposed for identifying the optimal set of features needed to detect sarcasm from tweets. This optimal set of features was employed to detect whether the tweet is sarcastic or not. After detecting sarcastic sentences, a multi-rule based approach has been proposed to determine the type of sarcasm. As an initial attempt, sarcasm has been classified into four types, namely, polite sarcasm, rude sarcasm, raging sarcasm, and deadpan sarcasm. ,e performance and efficiency of the proposed approach has been experimentally analyzed, and change in mood of a person for each sarcastic type has been modelled. The overall accuracy of the proposed ensemble feature selection algorithm for sarcasm detection is around 92.7%, and the proposed multi-rule approach for sarcastic type identification achieves an accuracy of 95.98%, 96.20%, 99.79%, and 86.61% for polite, rude, raging, and deadpan types of sarcasm, respectively.

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new aggregated classification scheme aimed to support the implementation of semantic text analysis methods in contexts characterized by the presence of rare text categories. The proposed approach starts from the aggregate supervised text classifier developed by Hopkins and King and moves forward, relying on rare event sampling methods. In detail, it enables the analyst to enlarge the number of estimated sentiment categories, both preserving the estimation accuracy and reducing the working time to unconditionally increase the size of the training set. The approach is applied to study the daily evolution of the web reputation of one of the last mega-event taking place in Europe: Expo Milano. The corpus consists of more than one million tweets in both Italian and English, discussing about the event. The analysis provides an interesting portrayal of the evolution of the Expo stakeholders’ opinions over time and allows the identification of the main drivers of the Expo reputation. The algorithm will be implemented as a running option in the next release of the R package ReadMe. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  doi       = {10.2196/26518},
  abstract  = {Background: COVID-19 cases resurged worldwide in the second half of 2020. Not much is known about the changes in public responses to containment measures from the initial outbreak to resurgence. Monitoring public responses is crucial to inform policy measures to prepare for COVID-19 resurgence. Objective: This study aimed to assess and compare public responses to containment measures during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in China. Methods: We curated all COVID-19-related posts from Sina Weibo (China’s version of Twitter) during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in Beijing, China. With a Python script, we constructed subsets of Weibo posts focusing on 3 containment measures: lockdown, the test-trace-isolate strategy, and suspension of gatherings. The Baidu open-source sentiment analysis model and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, a widely used machine learning algorithm, were used to assess public engagement, sentiments, and frequently discussed topics on each containment measure. Results: A total of 8,985,221 Weibo posts were curated. In China, the containment measures evolved from a complete lockdown for the general population during the initial outbreak to a more targeted response strategy for high-risk populations during COVID-19 resurgence. Between the initial outbreak and resurgence, the average daily proportion of Weibo posts with negative sentiments decreased from 57% to 47% for the lockdown, 56% to 51% for the test-trace-isolate strategy, and 55% to 48% for the suspension of gatherings. Among the top 3 frequently discussed topics on lockdown measures, discussions on containment measures accounted for approximately 32% in both periods, but those on the second-most frequently discussed topic shifted from the expression of negative emotions (11%) to its impacts on daily life or work (26%). The public expressed a high level of panic (21%) during the initial outbreak but almost no panic (1%) during resurgence. The more targeted test-trace-isolate measure received the most support (60%) among all 3 containment measures in the initial outbreak, and its support rate approached 90% during resurgence. Conclusions: Compared to the initial outbreak, the public expressed less engagement and less negative sentiments on containment measures and were more supportive toward containment measures during resurgence. Targeted test-trace-isolate strategies were more acceptable to the public. Our results indicate that when COVID-19 resurges, more targeted test-trace-isolate strategies for high-risk populations should be promoted to balance pandemic control and its impact on daily life and the economy.

  title     = {Detecting suicidal ideation on forums: Proof-of-concept study.},
  doi       = {10.2196/jmir.9840},
  abstract  = {Background: In 2016, 44,965 people in the United States died by suicide. It is common to see people with suicidal ideation seek help or leave suicide notes on social media before attempting suicide. Many prefer to express their feelings with longer passages on forums such as Reddit and blogs. Because these expressive posts follow regular language patterns, potential suicide attempts can be prevented by detecting suicidal posts as they are written. Objective: This study aims to build a classifier that differentiates suicidal and nonsuicidal forum posts via text mining methods applied on post titles and bodies. Methods: A total of 508,398 Reddit posts longer than 100 characters and posted between 2008 and 2016 on SuicideWatch, Depression, Anxiety, and ShowerThoughts subreddits were downloaded from the publicly available Reddit dataset. Of these, 10,785 posts were randomly selected and 785 were manually annotated as suicidal or nonsuicidal. Features were extracted using term frequency-inverse document frequency, linguistic inquiry and word count, and sentiment analysis on post titles and bodies. Logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms were applied on resulting corpus and prediction performance is evaluated. Results: The logistic regression and SVM classifiers correctly identified suicidality of posts with 80% to 92% accuracy and F1 score, respectively, depending on different data compositions closely followed by random forest, compared to baseline ZeroR algorithm achieving 50% accuracy and 66% F1 score. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that it is possible to detect people with suicidal ideation on online forums with high accuracy. The logistic regression classifier in this study can potentially be embedded on blogs and forums to make the decision to offer real-time online counseling in case a suicidal post is being written.

  abstract  = {Procrastination has been increasingly becoming the most prevailing behavior in humans globally. However, how we regard procrastination still remains ambiguous. Thus, the major purpose of this study is to identify people's emotional attitudes towards procrastination. Further, we also aim to clarify the potential role of such sentiments to procrastination. Using the domain-focus web crawling in social medias including Facebook, Twitter, Sina Weibo and Baidu Tieba, in conjunction with theory-driven data source theory, 5,613,807 users and resultant 18,809,276 original posts were scraped. Then, sentiment-focus analysis embodied in the natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was performed to quantify emotional attitudes. Results substantiated our hypothesis heavily by showing that procrastination was evaluated as negative behavior significantly. Further, significant interactions of age × gender and gender × education were found for people's negative emotions towards procrastination, showing more negative emotional attitudes towards procrastination in educated-less males. Ultimately, predictive role of such sentiments to procrastination was proven in the longitudinal mixed model. This study provides robust evidence to clarify the negative emotional attitudes towards procrastination in people, and further sheds light on the predictive role of such sentiments for it.

  doi       = {10.1371/journal.pone.0226408},
  abstract  = {Recent advances in computer-aided text analysis (CATA) have allowed organizational scientists to construct reliable and convenient measures from open texts. As yet, there is a lack of research into using CATA to analyze responses to open survey questions and constructing text-based measures of psychological constructs. In our study, we demonstrated the potential of CATA methods for the construction of text-based job satisfaction measures based on responses to a completely open and semi-open question. To do this, we employed three sentiment analysis techniques: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015, SentimentR and SentiStrength, and quantified the forms of measurement error they introduced: specific factor error, algorithm error and transient error. We conducted an initial test of the text-based measures’ validity, assessing their convergence with closed-question job satisfaction measures. We adopted a time-lagged survey design (Nwave 1 = 996; Nwave 2 = 116) to test our hypotheses. In line with our hypotheses, we found that specific factor error is higher in the open question text-based measure than in the semi-open question text-based measure. As expected, algorithm error was substantial for both the open and semi-open question text-based measures. Transient error in the text-based measures was higher than expected, as it generally exceeded the transient error in the human-coded and the closed job satisfaction question measures. Our initial test of convergent and discriminant validity indicated that the semi-open question text-based measure is especially suitable for measuring job satisfaction. Our article ends with a discussion of limitations and an agenda for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  doi       = {10.1016/j.dss.2014.05.005},
  abstract  = {In the era of Web 2.0, there has been an explosive growth of consumer-contributed comments at social media and electronic commerce Web sites. Applying state-of-the-art social analytics methodology to analyze the sentiments embedded in these consumer comments facilitates both firms' product design strategies and individual consumers' comparison shopping. However, existing social analytics methods often adopt coarse-grained and context-free sentiment analysis approaches. Consequently, these methods may not be effective enough to support firms and consumers' demands of fine-grained extraction of market intelligence from social media. Guided by the design science research methodology, the main contribution of our research is the design of a novel social analytics methodology that can leverage the sheer volume of consumer reviews archived at social media sites to perform a fine-grained extraction of market intelligence. More specifically, the proposed social analytics methodology is underpinned by a novel semi-supervised fuzzy product ontology mining algorithm. Evaluated based on real-world social media data, our prototype system shows remarkable performance improvement over a baseline ontology learning system and a context-free sentiment analysis system. The managerial implication of our research is that firms can apply the proposed social analytics methodology to tap into the collective social intelligence on the Web, and hence improve their product design and marketing strategies.

  abstract  = {Word Stemming is a widely used mechanism in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Language Modeling. Language-independent stemmers discover classes of morphologically related words from the ambient corpus without using any language related rules. In this article, we proposed a fully unsupervised language-independent text stemming technique that clusters morphologically related words from the corpus of the language using both lexical and co-occurrence features such as lexical similarity, suffix knowledge, and co-occurrence similarity. The method applies to a wide range of inflectional languages as it identifies morphological variants formed through different linguistic processes such as affixation, compounding, conversion, etc. The proposed approach has been tested in Information Retrieval application for four languages (English, Marathi, Hungarian, and Bengali) using standard TREC, CLEF, and FIRE test collections. A significant improvement over word-based retrieval, five other corpus-based stemmers, and rule-based stemmers has been achieved in all the languages. Besides, information retrieval, the proposed approach has also been tested in text classification and inflection removal tasks. Our algorithm excelled over other baseline methods in all the test scenarios. Thus, we successfully achieved the objective of developing a multipurpose stemming algorithm that cannot only be used for information retrieval task but also for non-traditional tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, inflection removal, etc. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {The multinomial distribution has been widely used to model count data. To increase clustering efficiency, we use an approximation to the Fisher scoring algorithm, which is more robust regarding the choice of initial parameter values. Then, we use a novel approach to estimate the optimal number of components, based on minimum message length criterion. Moreover, we consider a generalization of the multinomial model obtained by introducing the Dirichlet as prior, yielding the Dirichlet Compound Multinomial (DCM). Even though DCM can address the burstiness phenomenon of count data, the presence of Gamma function in its density function usually leads to undesired complications. In this article, we use two alternative representations of DCM distribution to perform clustering based on finite mixture models, where the mixture parameters are estimated using the minorization-maximization framework. To evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed models, we have considered three challenging real‐world applications that involve high‐dimensional count vectors, namely, sentiment analysis, facial expression recognition, and human action recognition. The results show that the proposed algorithms increase the clustering efficiency of their respective models remarkably, and the best results are achieved by the second parametrization of DCM, which can accommodate over‐dispersed count data.

  title     = {Modern survey estimation with social media and auxiliary data.},
  abstract  = {Traditional survey methods have been successful for nearly a century, but recently response rates have been declining and costs have been increasing, making the future of survey science uncertain. At the same time, new media sources are generating new forms of data, population data is increasingly readily available, and sophisticated machine learning algorithms are being created. This dissertation uses modern data sources and tools to improve survey estimates and advance the field of survey science.We begin by exploring the challenges of using data from new media, demonstrating how relationships between social media data and survey responses can appear deceptively strong. We examine a previously observed relationship between sentiment of "jobs" tweets and consumer confidence, performing a sensitivity analysis on how sentiment of tweets is calculated and sorting "jobs" tweets into categories based on their content, concluding that the original observed relationship was merely a chance occurrence. Next we track the relationship between sentiment of "Trump" tweets and presidential approval. We develop a framework to interpret the strength of this observed relationship by implementing placebo analyses, in which we perform the same analysis but with tweets assumed to be unrelated to presidential approval, concluding that our observed relationship is not strong. Failing to find a meaningful signal, we next propose following a set of users over time. For a set of politically active users, we are able to find evidence of a political signal in terms of frequency and sentiment of their tweets around the 2016 presidential election.In a given corpus of tweets, there are likely to be several topics present, which has the potential to introduce bias when using the corpus to track survey responses. To help discover and sort tweets into these topics, we create a clustering-based topic modeling algorithm. Using the entire corpus, we create distances between words based on how often they appear together in the same tweet, create distances between tweets based on the distance between words in the tweets, and perform clustering on the resulting distances. We show that this method is effective using a validation set of tweets and apply it to the corpus of tweets from politically active users and "jobs" tweets.Finally, we use population auxiliary data and machine learning algorithms to improve survey estimates. We develop an imputation-based estimation method that produces an unbiased estimate of the mean response of a finite population from a simple random sample when population auxiliary data are available. Our method allows for any prediction function or machine learning algorithm to be used to predict the response for out-of-sample observations, and is therefore able to accommodate a high dimensional setting and all covariate types. Exact unbiasedness is guaranteed by estimating the bias of the prediction function using subsamples of the original simple random sample. Importantly, the unbiasedness property does not depend on the accuracy of the imputation method. We apply this estimation method to simulated data, college tuition data, and the American Community Survey. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  doi       = {10.1016/j.knosys.2013.08.011},
  abstract  = {With the rapid growth of user-generated content on the internet, automatic sentiment analysis of online customer reviews has become a hot research topic recently, but due to variety and wide range of products and services being reviewed on the internet, the supervised and domain-specific models are often not practical. As the number of reviews expands, it is essential to develop an efficient sentiment analysis model that is capable of extracting product aspects and determining the sentiments for these aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised and domain-independent model for detecting explicit and implicit aspects in reviews for sentiment analysis. In the model, first a generalized method is proposed to learn multi-word aspects and then a set of heuristic rules is employed to take into account the influence of an opinion word on detecting the aspect. Second a new metric based on mutual information and aspect frequency is proposed to score aspects with a new bootstrapping iterative algorithm. The presented bootstrapping algorithm works with an unsupervised seed set. Third, two pruning methods based on the relations between aspects in reviews are presented to remove incorrect aspects. Finally the model employs an approach which uses explicit aspects and opinion words to identify implicit aspects. Utilizing extracted polarity lexicon, the approach maps each opinion word in the lexicon to the set of pre-extracted explicit aspects with a co-occurrence metric. The proposed model was evaluated on a collection of English product review datasets. The model does not require any labeled training data and it can be easily applied to other languages or other domains such as movie reviews. Experimental results show considerable improvements of our model over conventional techniques including unsupervised and supervised approaches.

  abstract  = {A great variety of text tasks such as topic or spam identification, user profiling, and sentiment analysis can be posed as a supervised learning problem and tackled using a text classifier. A text classifier consists of several subprocesses, some of them are general enough to be applied to any supervised learning problem, whereas others are specifically designed to tackle a particular task using complex and computational expensive processes such as lemmatization, syntactic analysis, etc. Contrary to traditional approaches, we propose a minimalist and multi-propose text-classifier able to tackle tasks independently of domain and language. We named our approach μTC. Our approach is composed of several easy-to-implement text transformations, text representations, and a supervised learning algorithm. These pieces produce a competitive classifier in several challenging domains such as informally written text. We provide a detailed description of μTC along with an extensive experimental comparison with relevant state-of-the-art methods, i.e., μTC was compared on 30 different datasets. Regarding accuracy, μTC obtained the best performance in 20 datasets while achieves competitive results in the remaining ones. The compared datasets include several problems like topic and polarity classification, spam detection, user profiling and authorship attribution. Furthermore, our approach allows the usage of the technology even without an in-depth knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing.

  title     = {Three facets of online political networks: Communities, antagonisms, and polarization.},
  abstract  = {Millions of users leave digital traces of their political engagements on social media platforms every day. Users form networks of interactions, produce textual content, like and share each others' content. This creates an invaluable opportunity to better understand the political engagements of internet users. In this proposal, I present three algorithmic solutions to three facets of online political networks; namely, detection of communities, antagonisms and the impact of certain types of accounts on political polarization. First, I develop a multi-view community detection algorithm to find politically pure communities. I find that word usage among other content types (i.e. hashtags, URLs) complement user interactions the best in accurately detecting communities. Second, I focus on detecting negative linkages between politically motivated social media users. Major social media platforms do not facilitate their users with built-in negative interaction options. However, many political network analysis tasks rely on not only positive but also negative linkages. Here, I present the SocLSFact framework to detect negative linkages among social media users. It utilizes three pieces of information; sentiment cues of textual interactions, positive interactions, and socially balanced triads. I evaluate the contribution of each three aspects in negative link detection performance on multiple tasks. Third, I propose an experimental setup that quantifies the polarization impact of automated accounts on Twitter retweet networks. I focus on a dataset of tragic Parkland shooting event and its aftermath. I show that when automated accounts are removed from the retweet network the network polarization decrease significantly, while a same number of accounts to the automated accounts are removed randomly the difference is not significant. I also find that prominent predictors of engagement of automatically generated content is not very different than what previous studies point out in general engaging content on social media. Last but not least, I identify accounts which self-disclose their automated nature in their profile by using expressions such as bot, chat-bot, or robot. I find that human engagement to self-disclosing accounts compared to non-disclosing automated accounts is much smaller. This observational finding can motivate further efforts into automated account detection research to prevent their unintended impact. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  doi       = {10.1007/s12559-017-9521-1},
  abstract  = {Analyzing human sentiments and emotions is a critical problem in cognitive computing. One fundamental task of sentiment analysis is to infer the sentiment polarity or emotion category of subjective text, such as microblogs. Most existing methods treat sentiment classification as a type of single-label supervised learning problem that classifies a microblog according to sentiment polarity or a single-labeled emotion. However, multiple fine-grained emotions may coexist in a single tweet or sentence of a microblog. We regard emotion detection in microblogs as a multi-label classification problem. First, we develop a graph-based algorithm to automatically build emotion lexicons, which are further utilized to construct distant-supervised corpora from massive microblog datasets. Then, a ranking-based multi-label convolutional neural network model (RM-CNN) that considers the order and relevance of labels is proposed to address emotion detection in microblogs. The RM-CNN model is pre-trained using the distant-supervised corpus and then fine-tuned using specific training data without the need for any manually designed features. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements of our proposed RM-CNN model over the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of multi-label classification metrics. We propose an effective RM-CNN model with a distant-supervised learning framework for detecting multiple coexisting emotions in the short text of microblogs.

  abstract  = {User generated (e.g., peer-to-peer or word-of-mouth) reviews and professional experts' reviews are important sources of external information that consumers use in making consumption decisions, but studies of their simultaneous effects is scarce. We develop a conceptual model for hypothesizing the simultaneous effects of the volume and valence of user and expert reviews on sales (i.e., box-office) revenue in the consumption of entertainment products (i.e., movies). We gather and analyze the User Generated Reviews (UGRs) using a text processing algorithm and evaluate resulting semantic networks to validate our approach. Combining these data with other relevant data from multiple sources for all Bollywood movies released over a six month period, we test the hypotheses proposed in the model. We find that, after controlling for effect of expert reviews, both volume and valence of user generated reviews have significant positive association with box-office revenue; however, valence evidences a curvilinear (saturation) effect such that positivity effect shows decreasing returns at high positivity levels. We also find that expert reviews positively affect box office revenue with little evidence of saturation or amplifying effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  doi       = {10.1155/2020/8858717},
  abstract  = {Text sentiment classification is an essential research field of natural language processing. Recently, numerous deep learning-based methods for sentiment classification have been proposed and achieved better performances compared with conventional machine learning methods. However, most of the proposed methods ignore the interactive relationship between contextual semantics and sentimental tendency while modeling their text representation. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Dual Attention Network (IDAN) model that aims to interactively learn the representation between contextual semantics and sentimental tendency information. Firstly, we design an algorithm that utilizes linguistic resources to obtain sentimental tendency information from text and then extract word embeddings from the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) pretraining model as the embedding layer of IDAN. Next, we use two Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks to learn the long range dependencies of contextual semantics and sentimental tendency information, respectively. Finally, two types of attention mechanisms are implemented in IDAN. One is multihead attention, which is the next layer of BiLSTM and is used to learn the interactive relationship between contextual semantics and sentimental tendency information. .e other is global attention that aims to make the model focus on the important parts of the sequence and generate the final representation for classification. These two attention mechanisms enable IDAN to interactively learn the relationship between semantics and sentimental tendency information and improve the classification performance. A large number of experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our IDAN model is superior to competitive methods. Moreover, both the result analysis and the attention weight visualization further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  doi       = {10.1016/j.knosys.2018.01.023},
  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis is focused on detecting opinions and emotions directly linked to relevant topics in textual data. Its application for the automated analysis of large datasets with text from websites has become a major challenge today. Common approaches proposed for this task are based on predefined dictionaries of words, each one tagged with a positive or negative polarity beforehand. A known limitation of these systems is that they may return inaccurate estimations of the polarity of opinions, according to the actual number of words considered in the analysis. In addition, these systems do not usually include an intuitive graphical interface to facilitate the understanding of similarities between terms or gauge how their sentiment polarization evolves over time. In this paper we present EmoWeb, a prototype of a new tool for dynamic sentiment analysis of textual content from websites. This prototype includes a visual and dynamic framework to analyze texts, based on a well-established lexicon. An unsupervised learning algorithm can append new words and calculate or update their sentiment polarization and strength over time. Moreover, it can increase the number of words considered for sentiment analysis to improve the accuracy of results. A novel dynamic visualization module makes it easier for end users to interpret sentiments associated to terms and their changes. The prototype has been empirically evaluated in two experiments with real data gathered from news websites. Results are promising and illustrate the applicability of this approach for sentiment analysis of textual web content. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {Big data created by social media and mobile networks provide an exceptional opportunity to mine valuable insights from them. This information is harnessed by business entities to measure the level of customer satisfaction but its application in disaster response is still in its inflection point. Social networks are increasingly used for emergency communications and help related requests. During disaster situations, such emergency requests need to be mined from the pool of big data for providing timely help. Though government organizations and emergency responders work together through their respective national disaster response framework, the sentiment of the affected people during and after the disaster determines the success of the disaster response and recovery process. In this paper, we propose a big data driven approach for disaster response through sentiment analysis. The proposed model collects disaster data from social networks and categorize them according to the needs of the affected people. The categorized disaster data are classified through machine learning algorithm for analyzing the sentiment of the people. Various features like, parts of speech and lexicon are analyzed to identify the best classification strategy for disaster data. The results show that lexicon based approach is suitable for analyzing the needs of the people during disaster. The practical implication of the proposed methodology is the real-time categorization and classification of social media big data for disaster response and recovery. This analysis helps the emergency responders and rescue personnel to develop better strategies for effective information management of the rapidly changing disaster environment.

This paper develops a sentence-based language model to perform sentiment classification at a fine-grained sentence level. The proposed approach applies a machine learning method to determine the sentiment polarity of a sentence at first, then designs statistical algorithm to compute the weight of the sentence in sentiment classification of the whole document and at last aggregates the weighted sentence to predict the sentiment polarity of document. Besides, experiments are carried out on corpuses in different evaluation domains and languages, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sentence-based approach in obtaining a more accurate result of sentiment classification across different reviews. Furthermore, the experimental results also indicate that the position and the sentiment of a sentence have great impact on predicting the sentiment polarity of document, and corpuses with different evaluative objects, languages and sentiments also greatly influence the performance of sentiment classification. It is believed that these conclusions will be a good inspiration for similar researches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

One of the challenges of current practices is that these methods rely heavily on traditional data collection and analysis methods such as questionnaires, and face to face or telephone interviews, which have a significant time lag. In this paper we introduce a computational model that combines topic and sentiment classification to elicit influential subjects from consumer perceptions in social media. Our model devises a novel genetic algorithm to improve clustering of tweets in semantically coherent groups, which act as an essential prerequisite when searching for prevailing topics and sentiment in big pools of data. To illustrate the validity of our model, we apply it to the Uber transportation network, from data collected through Twitter for the period between January and April 2015. The results obtained present consumer perceptions and produce insights for two fundamental brand equity dimensions: brand awareness and brand meaning. Simultaneously, they improve clustering results, in comparison to the k-means approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {The breeding and spreading of negative emotion in public emergencies posed severe challenges to social governance. The traditional government information release strategies ignored the negative emotion evolution mechanism. Focusing on the information release policies from the perspectives of the government during public emergency events, by using cognitive big data analytics, our research applies deep learning method into news framing framework construction process, and tries to explore the influencing mechanism of government information release strategy on contagion-evolution of negative emotion. In particular, this paper first uses Word2Vec, cosine word vector similarity calculation and SO-PMI algorithms to build a public emergencies-oriented emotional lexicon; then, it proposes a emotion computing method based on dependency parsing, designs an emotion binary tree and dependency-based emotion calculation rules; and at last, through an experiment, it shows that the emotional lexicon proposed in this paper has a wider coverage and higher accuracy than the existing ones, and it also performs a emotion evolution analysis on an actual public event based on the emotional lexicon, using the emotion computing method proposed. And the empirical results show that the algorithm is feasible and effective. The experimental results showed that this model could effectively conduct fine-grained emotion computing, improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of sentiment classification. The final empirical analysis found that due to such defects as slow speed, non transparent content, poor penitence and weak department coordination, the existing government information release strategies had a significant negative impact on the contagion-evolution of anxiety and disgust emotion, could not regulate negative emotions effectively. These research results will provide theoretical implications and technical supports for the social governance.

India's rate of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing day by day, placing India in the top ten emitters in the world. Air pollution is one of the significant contributors to the greenhouse effect. Transportation contributes about 10% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer's sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers' towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study. The results showed the efficiency of deep learning algorithms and found CNN yield better results in-compare to others. The proposed optimal model will help consumers, designers and manufacturers in their decision-making capabilities to choose, design and manufacture EV.

  abstract  = {Sentiment classification is an important branch of cognitive computation--thus the further studies of properties of sentiment analysis is important. Sentiment classification on text data has been an active topic for the last two decades and learning-based methods are very popular and widely used in various applications. For learning-based methods, a lot of enhanced technical strategies have been used to improve the performance of the methods. Feature selection is one of these strategies and it has been studied by many researchers. However, an existing unsolved difficult problem is the choice of a suitable number of features for obtaining the best sentiment classification performance of the learning-based methods. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between the number of features selected and the sentiment classification performance of the learning-based methods. A new method for the selection of a suitable number of features is proposed in which the Chi Square feature selection algorithm is employed and the features are selected using a preset score threshold. It is discovered that there is a relationship between the logarithm of the number of features selected and the sentiment classification performance of the learning-based method, and it is also found that this relationship is independent of the learning-based method involved. The new findings in this research indicate that it is always possible for researchers to select the appropriate number of features for learning-based methods to obtain the best sentiment classification performance. This can guide researchers to select the proper features for optimizing the performance of learning-based algorithms.

  doi       = {10.1002/smj.3067},
  abstract  = {Research Summary: We demonstrate how a novel synthesis of three methods--(a) unsupervised topic modeling of text data to generate new measures of textual variance, (b) sentiment analysis of text data, and (c) supervised ML coding of facial images with a cutting‐edge convolutional neural network algorithm--can shed light on questions related to CEO oral communication. With videos and corresponding transcripts of interviews with emerging market CEOs, we use this synthesis of methods to discover five distinct communication styles that incorporate both verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication. Our data comprises interviews that represent unedited expressions and content, making them especially suitable as data sources for the measurement of an individual's communication style. We then perform a proof‐of‐concept analysis, correlating CEO communication styles to M&A outcomes, highlighting the value of combining text and videographic data to define styles. We also discuss the benefits of using our methods versus current research methods. Managerial Summary: CEOs spend most of their time communicating to investors, customers, and partners with the aim of influencing these various stakeholders. To what extent though does their effectiveness as leaders depend on a mixture of what they say and how they say it? We use cutting‐edge machine learning approaches to measure a CEO's communication style, which can give clues about the major strategic decisions a CEO's firm must make. With a collection of video interviews with 61 organizational leaders from emerging markets, we use textual analysis and facial image expression recognition to code whether CEOs are “excitable,” “stern,” “dramatic,” “rambling,” and “melancholy” in their communication styles. As a proof‐of‐concept, we also show that CEOs who were more dramatic in expressing themselves were also less likely to oversee major acquisitions. Therefore, not only can CEO communication styles help predict a firm's ability to grow, adapt to change, and reallocate existing assets, styles can also be coded more intuitively by using our new method, representing a vast improvement over previous methods in both accessibility and interpretability.

  title     = {Generating post hoc review-based natural language justifications for recommender systems.},
  doi       = {10.1007/s11257-020-09270-8},
  abstract  = {In this article, we present a framework to build post hoc natural language justifications that supports the suggestions generated by a recommendation algorithm. Our methodology is based on the intuition that reviews’ excerpts contain much relevant information that can be used to justify a recommendation; thus, we propose a black-box explanation strategy that takes as input a recommended item and a set of reviews and builds as output a post hoc natural language justification which is completely independent of the underlying recommendation model. To validate our claims, we also introduce three different implementations of our conceptual framework: the first one uses natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques to identify relevant and distinguishing aspects discussed in the reviews and combines reviews’ excerpts mentioning these aspects in a natural language justification which is presented to the target user. The second implementation extends the first one by introducing automatic aspect extraction and text summarization, which are exploited to generate a unique synthesis presenting the main characteristics of the item that is used as justification. Finally, the third implementation tackles the problem of generating a context-aware justification, that is to say, a justification that differs on varying of the different contextual situations, by automatically learning a lexicon for each contextual setting and by using such a lexicon to diversify the justifications. In the experimental evaluation, we carried out three user studies in different domains, and the results showed that our methodology is able to make the recommendation process more transparent, engaging and trustful for the users, thus confirming the validity of the intuitions behind this work.

  doi       = {10.1007/s11205-020-02319-6},
  abstract  = {Since 2012, driven by the desire to propose a subjective well-being index (SWBI) complementary to the traditional measures, with high time and space frequency, our team evaluates, analysing Twitter data, a composite index that captures various aspects and dimensions of individual and collective life. The SWBI is a multidimensional indicator whose components were inspired by the dimensions adopted for the Happy Planet Index provided by the New Economic Foundation. In detail, it consists of eight dimensions that describe three different areas: personal well-being, social well-being and well-being at work. The Italian subjective well-being index (SWBIITA), that we display here, audits the Italian subjective well-being revealed by tweets acquired via the public Twitter API, written in the Italian language, and posted from Italy from January 2012 to December 2017. Around 1-5% of the data includes geo-referenced information, which allows us to provide an index at local level. The Twitter data analysis is carried on with a human supervised sentiment analysis method, the Integrated Sentiment Analysis (iSA) algorithm. In this work, after a weighting procedure adopted to partially overcome the selection bias caused by the use of data from social network, we describe the SWBIITA dimensions in the considered period at the regional level. Moreover, for some dimensions, for which a similar currently available measure provided by Italian official statistics exists, comparisons are proposed emphasizing novelties, similarities and differences.

  title     = {Twitter sentiment analysis: Capturing sentiment from integrated resort tweets.},
  doi       = {10.1016/j.ijhm.2016.02.001},
  abstract  = {The article presents a study which uses a dictionary-based method to analyze social media microblogging data from Twitter. Data for this study was acquired from the Twitter application programming interface (API). The Twitter API is a backend server that warehouses all individuals’ tweets and enables data collection by the public. The site allows roughly the past week of historical data to be extracted from its database. The property sentiment scores over the eight weeks of data collection are provided. In general, positive sentiment outweighs negative sentiment, as all firm had positive average sentiment scores, and positive ratio scores. On average, there were 928 tweets per account, with the MGM Grand account having the most tweets (2832), and Hooter’s casino the fewest (187). While many commonly known luxury brands such as Aria, Bellagio, and Venetian appear in the top five average sentiment score rank, less well known properties, such as Tropicana or the local market serving Red Rock and M Resort, also appear within the top ten. The appearance of these firms suggests that these metrics are capturing more information than simple views on hotel rankings. This study described the usefulness of sentiment analysis of social media sites to hospitality operators. In particular, this study demonstrated how Twitter data could be analyzed through a cost effective application to Las Vegas integrated-resort casino accounts. The study showed that using a relatively straightforward scoring algorithm with a publicly available lexicon will yield a set of sentiment metrics that have reasonable reliability and convergent validity with external hotel rankings. As compared to Tripadvisor’s ranking, the sentiment scores appear to be reasonably effective at capturing real-time information: not only existing customers’ review on their hotel stay, but also the public’s buzz toward important short-term events and marketing campaigns.
